to use dask on ucsd, follow setup instruction from this repo:

https://github.com/aminnj/daskucsd

for now, I send this analysisenv.tar.gz to condor node, analysisenv.tar.gz, but it is probably too big

the only notebook works with dask is this one: try_ucsddask.ipynb
everything under "import numba as nb" is still under commisioning... and yes it is messy...
